<h1>History</h1>
<p>Cole Park is located on 85th and King Drive. The Park became legendary for black residents back in 1960s. Cole Park had basketball courts, swings, slides, even a place to run and exercise. The Basketball Courts brought competitiveness and respect. Games felt like hanging out with family ultimately building a community within the black culture and uniting us. Now I drive by cole park and I see almost nobody if not anybody there it seems abandon now. And my goal is to refurbish this park and restore the black community within.</p>

    <h1>Pitch</h1>
<p>My Plans to Bring Back cole park back to its glory is simple. First we need to clear up the basketball courts and outside areas. Replace old nets with new ones and mow the field so it's safe to run and play on. 2nd we need to clean field houses and deep clean slides and swings and Add benches for family to host events and eat. Third we need to advertise a NEW cole Park. And ultimately after this cole park can be a Place where people within the black community can connect and have fun. </p>
